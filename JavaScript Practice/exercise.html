      <h1>Welcome to your First Exercise!</h1>

      <p>For this exercise, we will be creating a weight metric converter</p>

      <p>We will take in a number in pounds (Ibs) and convert it to kilogram (kg). Right now we only know enough to do this one way, but later on we will learn how to add logic to this sort of problem.</p>

      <p>To complete this exercise do the following: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Link this HTML file(exercise.html) to your own js file.</li>
        <li>Use Javascript to accept a no. of input in pounds(Ibs).</li>
        <li>Then, in your own js file convert this number to kg.(*0.454)</li>
        <li>Afterwards report back in an alert what the weight is in kg</li>
        <li>Then log/write "Conversion Completed" to the console</li>
      </ul>
